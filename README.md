# brosaen-lektor

Static website for brosaen.com built with [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/).

To run:

```
$ lektor server
```

Note: the mp3 files are not in the repository so audio playback won't work. You can place the mp3 files in the appropriate content directories if you wish to see how it works, e.g

```
$ (cd content/podcasts/pistons/26; curl -O http://brosaen.com/podcasts/pistons/26/brosaen-episode-26.mp3)
```
