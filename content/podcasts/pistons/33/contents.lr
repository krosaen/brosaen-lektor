description: The brothers take stock of a disappointing season for a supposed young team on the rise. We take detailed look at the numbers for our offense, and discuss how Reggie's injury problems and Andre's struggles fit into the picture. Plus, a brief look at our main rotation players, SVG's overall performance as a coach, and what our best options are going forward.
